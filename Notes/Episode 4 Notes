**Build a Real world application
1.Food Ordering App using React :-
--Steps:-
    -- UI Design/wireframe.
    --Planning a component

--If you repeate some code or component.
 --here restaurant card we can use it many time. so it becomes reusable component.
 -- so create restaurant card as component separately.

 **Props:- means properties means you have to pass something to the component.
 -- If you want to pass data dynamically to compoent we use props.
 --props are just normal argument to a function.
 Ex:- <RestaurantCard resName="meghana Fooda" cuisine="biryani"/> this resName and cuisine are the props which are passing data to RestaurantCard compoennt.
 --props is end of end object.

 **Way of passing data to component:-
 --From backend we get json type data.sometime it is complicated.

 **Json viewr --chrome extension-- to see json data **

 **Config DrivenS UI:-
    --UI is basically driven by config.
    --Config means data==diff data

**Array join():-
  --The join() method returns an array as a string.
  --The join() method does not change the original array.
  --Any separator can be specified. The default is comma (,).
  --Syntax:-array.join(separator)

**Array map():-
--map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element.
--map() does not execute the function for empty elements.
--map() does not change the original array.
Ex:-
{resList.map((restaurant) => (
    <RestaurantCard resData={resturant}/>
))}

**key :- 
--Always user key
--Always use unique key.
--not good practice to use index as key.
--if unique id is not present then as a last approach use index as key.
